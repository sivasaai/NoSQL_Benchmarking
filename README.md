# NoSQL_Benchmarking
This project contains the steps and required files to perform bench marking MongoDB and Cassandra using Yahoo! cloud serving benchmark(YCSB) done for the Term Paper for Advanced Computer Networks.

# Environment Used
- RockyLinux 8.5 Operating System. (Rocky Linux is an open-source enterprise operating system designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Red Hat Enterprise LinuxÂ®. It is under intensive development by the community.)
- 4GB RAM
- 100 GB Disk
- 4 CPUS of model 64 bit  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 0 @ 2.00GHz

# Steps to setup MongoDB for Benchmarking
- Install MongoDB using the steps specified here in the url - https://www.golinuxcloud.com/install-mongodb-rocky-linux/#:~:text=Install%20MongoDB%20on%20Rocky%20Linux%208.4%20%28Step-by-Step%29%201,SELinux%20...%208%20Step%208%3A%20Uninstall%20MongoDB%20

- connect to the mongodb prompt using the command `mongo` in the terminal.
- switch to admin using following command.

# Steps to setup Cassandra for Benchmarking
-  Install openjdk using command.
`sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel`
- Setup cassandra repo for installing casandra, Add cassandra.repo file with following content to /etc/yum.repos.d/


`[cassandra]`

`name=Apache Cassandra`

`baseurl=https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/redhat/311x/`

`gpgcheck=1`

`repo_gpgcheck=1`

`gpgkey=https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/KEYS`


- Install cassandra package

`yum install -y cassandra`

- Start cassandra service using command `systemctl start cassandra`

- connect to Cassandra client prompt using command `cqlsh`

- Create a keyspace with name `ycsb` using the following command.
`create keyspace ycsb WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':3};`

-  Create usertable using following command.

# Installation of YCSB tool.
-  Download tar archive of the YCSB tool using following command 

`curl -O -location https://github.com/brainfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/download/0.15.0/ycsb-0.15.0.tar.gz`

- untar the downloaded archive using the following command

`tar -xvfz ycsb-0.15.0.tar.gz`

- change current directory to `ycsb-0.15.0`
 using the following command.

`cd ycsb-0.15.0`

- All the predefined workload files can be found in `../ycsb-0.15.0/workloads/*`

# Important parameters updated or changed in workload files for different tests for this term paper.

- `recordcount:` This decides number of records to be loaded when ran ycsb with load option.
- `operationcount:` This decides number of operations to be run for the test run.
- `readpropotion`: This parameter decides how much percent of operations of operationcount will be read operations.
- `insertpropotion`: This parameter decides how much percent of operations of operationcount will be insert operations.
- `updatepropotion`: This parameter decides how much percent of operations of operationcount will be update operations.


# Custom work loads.

- For the purpose of testing the Update Heavy workloads and Update only workload , the following two custom workloads were added.
- workloadg(This is upload heavy workload which has 5% of read operations and 95 % of update operations)
for this `readproportion` is set to 0.05 and `updateproportion`  is set to 0.95.
- workloadf(This is upload only workload which is 100% of update of operations)
for this `readproportion` is set to 0 and `updateproportion`  is set to 1.00.
- `workloadg` and `workloadf` files are added in the repostiory for the use.

# How to load data using ycsb in cassandra?
- The following command is used to load a data of 100000 records in cassandra
`./bin/ycsb load cassandra-cql -p hosts="127.0.0.1" -s -P workloads/workloada -p recordcount=100000`
- recordcount parameter could be changed to a different number depending the rquirement to load more or less records.

# How to load data using ycsb in MongoDB?
- The following command is used to load a data of 100000 records in cassandra
` ./bin/ycsb load mongodb -s -P workloads/workloada -p recordcount=280000 -p  mongodb.url="mongodb://MongoUser:Password@127.0.0.1:27017" -p mongodb.auth="true"`
- recordcount parameter could be changed to a different number depending the rquirement to load more or less records.

# How to run a workload on cassandra using ycsb?.

- The following command is used to run `workloada` for a loaded data of 700000 records

`./bin/ycsb run cassandra-cql -p hosts="127.0.0.1" -s -P workloads/workloada -p recordcount=700000`


# How to run a workload on MongoDB using ycsb?


- The following command is used to run `workloada` for a loaded data of 700000 records

`./bin/ycsb run mongodb -s -P workloads/workloadh -p recordcount=700000 -p mongodb.url="mongodb://mongoAdmin:changeMe@127.0.0.1:27017" -p mongodb.auth="true"`

# How to get the execution time from the output of the ycsb workload runs.

- Data loading or workload runs gives the similar to the following screen shot.

- `[OVERALL], RunTime(ms)` in the output implies execution time.

# Steps followed for the data collected for the experimental evaluation of the paper.

1. Run the ycsb command to load 100,000 records  in cassandra/mongodb as shown in earlier sections.
2. Collect the execution time of data loading into excel sheet.
3. Run workloada on cassandra/mongodb for 100,000 records and 100,000 operations (operationcount in workload is updated same as record count for this).
4. Collect the execution time of workloada for 100,000 records into excel sheet.
5. Repeat 3 & 4 for all the workloads B,C,F,G,H.
6. do one of the following depending on whether it is for mongodb or cassandra.
- For cassandra: truncate the usertable using following command in cqlsh prompt.

`truncate table ycsb.usertable;`
- For MongoDB: drop the usertable collection from ycsb table using following command.

`db.usertable.drop()`

7. Reboot the machine.
8. repeat it 1 to 7, 2 more times and not the average of the values recorded for all the three runs for 100,000 records.
9. repeat 1 to 8 for 2,80,000 records and 7,00,00.
